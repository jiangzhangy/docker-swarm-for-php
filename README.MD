# Project Title

This project leverages Docker and Docker Swarm to create a scalable, highly available, and consistent development, testing, and production environment for web applications. By containerizing services such as Nginx, PHP, MySQL, and Redis, it ensures environment consistency across different stages of development, simplifies deployment processes, and enhances data persistence and security. This approach not only facilitates rapid development and deployment cycles but also addresses challenges related to scalability, data consistency, and system availability, making it an invaluable tool for developers and operations teams aiming for efficient and reliable web application deployment and management.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

docker
docker compose


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/jiangzhangy/docker-swarm-for-php.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd docker-swarm-for-php
cp .env.example .env


Build and run the Docker containers:

docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml yourproject


### Environment Variables

Explain how to set up the necessary environment variables, if any.

MYSQL_VERSION=8.0.36
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret
MYSQL_DATABASE=laravel
MYSQL_USER=laravel
MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret
PHP_VERSION=8.2
INSTALL_OPCACHE=true
NGINX_VERSION=1.21.1
REDIS_VERSION=6.2.5


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end-to-end tests

Explain what these tests test and why.
